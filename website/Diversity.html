			Here at Developing Diversity, we have a passion for data analysis, and we believe in the value of quantification. 
			Often, visualizing exactly what a problem looks like is the push in the right direction that ultimately leads to a solution. 
			And, after over a year of quarantine and job loss and economic turmoil, we know that the world is in dire need of solutions.
		</p>
		<p  style= "font-size: 20px">
			So, during the ExploreHacks 2021 Hackathon, we began developing a website with a data analysis software to quantify companies’ levels of diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). </br>
			Here, we work with companies’ employee data to assess diversity and find hidden bias, and then we provide concrete tips on how to combat bias and increase DEI. </br>
			In doing this, we hope to create a sense of community and belonging within a workplace, so that no one will be undervalued or mistreated. </br>

		<font face = "Courier"><header style= "font-size: 35px"> <u> <b>Why Do Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Matter? </b></u> </header></font><br />
		<p  style= "font-size: 20px">
			Because two heads are better than one. </br>
			Because when an office, school, or movie set becomes an echo chamber for the white man, everyone else is drowned out. </br>
			Valuable ideas and creative solutions are muffled, and cries for help are silenced as they come. </br>
			Diversity matters because regardless of race, skin color, gender, sexual orientation, or financial status, everyone’s voices deserve to be heard. </br>
		</p>
		<font face = "Courier"><h1 style= "font-size: 30px"> <b> But diversity alone isn't enough. </b> </h1> </font>
		<p  style= "font-size: 20px">
			Having some minority employees or a few female administrators isn’t enough if their work isn’t being pushed forward or valued. </br>
			If these marginalized voices aren’t being amplified to the same volume as everyone else’s, then that’s not inclusion. </br>
			That’s tokenism––just a symbolic action that squeezes in some people from underrepresented groups, without truly valuing their contributions.</br>
		</p>
		<font face = "Courier"><h1 style= "font-size: 30px"> <b>Inclusion is just as necessary as diversity </b> </h1> </font>
		<p  style= "font-size: 20px">
			Inclusion is what actively allows for open dialogue and promotes creativity, making companies more representative and in-tune to their consumers’ needs. </br>
			In fact, it has been proven that diverse and inclusive companies do better! </br>
			When companies establish inclusive business cultures and policies, they are more likely to report 59.1% increases in creativity, innovation, and openness, and 37.9% better assessment of consumer interest and demand. </br>
			But with the undying systems of oppression in the United States that rob people of opportunities right under our noses, creating diversity and inclusion is much easier said than done. </br>
			It’s not just a one-time “Everyone is equally valued and considered at this company now!” </br>
			It’s not a rule that can be announced and then followed.</br>
		</p>
		<font face = "Courier"><h1 style= "font-size: 30px"> <b>Diversity and Inclusion have to be built. </b> </h1> </font>
		<p  style= "font-size: 20px">
			Systems that increase equity have to be created, enforced, and advertised to the people who need them. </br>
			They need to be flexible and change to fit the organization’s social climate, and they need to be modeled based on the requests of the people they are made for. </br>

		<p  style= "font-size: 20px">
			Reprogramming the culture of a workplace to become richer and more inclusive is no easy task, so our data analysis software helps companies clearly see the level of diversity, equity, and inclusion present within them. </br>
			After our algorithms quantify their levels of DEI, they can turn their attention to our Solutions tab. </br>
			There, we provide ways for companies to become more equitable, such as blind hiring methods and employee feedback systems. </br>

		</div> </br>
		<p  style= "font-size: 20px">
			However, even with all of our data, we stress that the benefits of DEI cannot be obtained if a company is just recruiting new employees for the sake of meeting a quota. </br>
			True DEI is intrinsically marked by the understanding that people of every background are valuable and should be appreciated. </br>
